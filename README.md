# InvoiceLogger

This is a small application that allows users to create invoices and save them locally.

The artchitecture of the app is MVVM and it uses coordinators for navigation. 

There are three pages in the application, one containing the invoices table, one showing the details of any selected invoice, and one allowing users to create new invoices.
The app uses CoreData to save and retrieve invoices on the device.

**Limitations**
Due to time limitations, the following are not supported:
- Long titles and locations
- Editing invoices
- Deleting invoices
- Adding multiple photos for the same invoice
- Getting to see the image in full size when tapping on it
